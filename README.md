# Isabel Rodriguez Project 2


## Description 
For this project we were asked to create a website with a search engine. 
I have created a giphy search engine that allows you to type in different keywords to display various GIFs. 

## Functionality of page
- At the top of the page is a navbar that allows the user to click on different links to get to a specific page faster. 
- In the body of the page a searchbar and search button was inserted so users can easily type in keywords and click search 
to find the GIFS they are looking for
- Below the search bar is where the loaded GIFS will appear for easy browsing

## Technologies Used 
- HTML
- CSS
- BootStrap
- JavaScript

## User Story
1. As a user, I want to search for GIFs by keyword so I can find items that match my interests
2. As a user, I want the results to load in a clean and organized grid so I can browse through them quickly and easily
3. As a user, I want to be able to press the Enter button to search instead of clicking the search button for a quicker search
